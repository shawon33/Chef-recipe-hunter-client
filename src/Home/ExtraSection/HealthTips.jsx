                <h1 className="text-success">Regular Exercise</h1>
                <p>Engage in regular physical activity that suits your fitness level and preferences. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Include strength training exercises to maintain muscle mass and flexibility exercises for mobility.</p>
                <p>Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.

                    Regular trips to the gym are great, but do not worry if you can not find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any amount of activity is better than none at all. To reap the benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day — take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is key.</p>

                <p>People often cut back on their sleep for work, for family demands, or even to watch a good show on television.

                    Even one night of short sleep can affect you the next day. Not only are you more likely to feel sleepy, you’re more likely to be in a bad mood, be less productive at work, and be involved in a motor vehicle crash.</p>
                <p> Make sure you get an adequate amount of sleep each night. Most adults require 7-9 hours of sleep, while teenagers and children need more. Establish a regular sleep routine and create a comfortable sleep environment.</p>
